a work in progress game of my take on a 1 v 1 death game genre made with Unity

# Game Rules:
1. Players start with 4 lives
2. Users can wager as many organs per round
3. There are 11 number cards, (-1 to 9)
4. There are 5 operations available (+, -, /, *, and U)
    - Magnet is an operation that combines the two numbers selected. i.e. 5 U 1 = 51, 6 U -1 = -61
6. When the count of certain organs (Lung, Brain, Heart, Kidney) turn to 0, the player loses the game
7. The users can view the number cards selected but not their operation. Instead, they have access to the opponent's operation value
8. The organ's ability are as follows
    - Brain: Doubles the first number card's value
    - Heart: Tells you the exact value of the opponent's card
    - Lung: Refreshes the operation or number at hand
    - Kidney: Filters out 2 of the 5 possible operations
    - Eye: Tells you if the user's number card is higher than the opponent's number or not
    - Rib: Regenerates a random organ that's been used except for the rib itself

# Gameplay Flow:
1. Pick one number card (the 11 cards on the bottom of the screen)
2. Pick an operation (the 5 cards on top of the number cards
3. Wager organs
